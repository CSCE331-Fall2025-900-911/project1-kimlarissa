            <h2>Engineering TA Organization</h2>
            <p>
                Engineering TA (Teacher Assistant) Organization, or commonly known as ENGR TAO, 
                is a student organization dedicated to enhancing the freshman engineering course experience.
                <br><br>
                I first started off as a software engineer intern in the summer at ENGR TAO to help build their website, 
                which would be used to display information about engineering review sessions and keep review materials at one place.
                You can check out the website <a href="https://engrtao.tech/">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                After the summer, I decided to take on the role of Vice President of the organization. I now dedicate most of my time planning events that help freshmen engineering students get the support that they need in their
                first year to grow as a proficient engineer. I often plan events such as our annual Big Tech Intern Panel, ETAM Essay Review Sessions, and much more. Another big part of our service to the community
                also comes from the <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a>, where the ENGR TAO leadership team was able to get together to do yard work for the Bryan/College Station community.

            <h2>Stepping Stones Tutoring Organization</h2>
            <p>
                During the height of COVID-19, many young students from elementary to high school were struggling to keep up in their academic studies.
                Zoom classes were new to all of us at the time, and many students were not able to get the help that they needed academically. Especially in mathematics,
                math is an essential course that builds life skills in finance, engineering, and critical thinking and young students were espcially victims of falling behind in this foundational subject.
                <br><br>
                Me and a couple of my friends decided to get together and found the Stepping Stones Tutoring Organization, an organization aimed to help young students
                and supplement their learning in math courses. We developed a system where we would match volunteer tutors with students based on their availability and grade level.
                <br><br>
                At our peak, we were able to tutor 90+ young students and manage 30+ volunteers. Supporting our community during a time of need was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had, and I am glad that we were able to make a difference in our community.
